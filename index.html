        <h1>Fondu ICO</h1>
        <h6>Interactive White Paper [<a href="https://fondu.io?lang=en">English</a>, <a href="https://fondu.io?lang=ru">Russian</a>, <a href="https://fondu.io?lang=ch">Chinese</a>]</h6>
        <h6>Author: <a href="https://t.me/borodutch">Nikita Kolmogorov</a></h6>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This paper is a proposal to the whole crypto and open source community to save millions of dollars by providing emerging and underrated startups with the key services they need to emerge. Swamped with parasitical speculators, imitators, and scammers that continue to leach on the industry by misleading investors and developers alike, the ICO market is sick and we need to fix it.</p>

        <p>As we all know, automation continues to bring efficiency to businesses and applications around the world. Why should the ICO market be any different? We are proposing a unique solution to this problem by allowing our community to create semi-automatic open sourced services to create and manage all kinds of ICOs. With minimal steps, users will be able to fill in their ICO profile, configure the smart-contract with a series of simple questions, and start raising money with a market-ready website.</p>

        <p>If you have ever conducted an ICO, you know that writing a smart contract can be as costly as $10,000 to $75,000, and marketing costs can run as high as $30,000 to $70,000. Often, developers find that once they have spent all their money, they are left with only a generic website and a slightly modified ERC20 token smart-contract. Thus raising the question: why can't it be done automatically?</p>

        <h2>Product</h2>
        <p>The solution that we propose consists of three simple modules: the ICO constructor, the ICO presenter and the Investor Personal Profile. Let us explain each of them in detail.</p>
        <ul class="article_list">
          <li><b>The ICO constructor:</b> a simple webpage with forms to be filled in with critical ICO information such as the token name, team details, product description, logo, screenshots, social network contacts, legal details, whitepaper, roadmap, etc. The Smart-contract constructor is a part of this module, allowing you to fill simple forms, answer a series of multiple-choice questions, and get a smart-contract deployed to the ETH and/or EOS blockchain immediately.</li>
          <li><b>The ICO presenter:</b> after constructing the ICO, you will get a personalized profile page that acts as the main landing page for the ICO and contains all the necessary information for investors including live ICO progress (displaying the smart-contract state in the real time), important milestones, and the contract address. Everything is hosted on Fondu platform and has zero costs associated with its upkeep.</li>
          <li><b>The Investor Personal Profile:</b> one of the most difficult to implement and expensive aspects of running any ICO, this module allows potential investors to pre-register for the sale and seek approval. As well as being a perfect tool to provide KYC and whitelisting functionality to the ICO conductors, we intend to make this module a part of the initial release, as it will allow for drastically reduced costs associated with running an ICO while improving the overall investor user experience. </li>
        </ul>  
        <p>The main goal of our project is to democratize the ICO concept for all, enabling anyone to theoretically access smart-contracts in order to conduct any type of crowd funding. Whether it is something positive, like funding a wedding with the help of guests (instead of them buying presents), or rather unfortunate, like funding a complex medical operation for someone in need, everybody ought to be able to launch an ICO without headache and a large capital investment.</p>
        <p>In case you’re wondering how difficult it is to build what we have just described, look at what I've written in 5 minutes while drinking my morning coffee:</p>

        <!-- Profile Constructor Vue -->
        <div id="profile-constructor">
          <div class="container-fluid">
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm left-bordered">
                <form>
                  <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Enter title" v-model="title">
                  <textarea class="form-control" placeholder="Enter product description" v-model="description"></textarea>
                  <textarea class="form-control" placeholder="Enter team details" v-model="team"></textarea>
                  <textarea class="form-control" placeholder="Enter legal details" v-model="legal"></textarea>
                </form>
              </div>
              <div class="col-sm left-bordered">
                <h4>{{ title || titleSample }}</h4>
                <p>{{ description || descriptionSample }}</p>
                <h4>Team:</h4>
                <p>{{ team || teamSample }}</p>
                <h4>Legal:</h4>
                <p>{{ legal || legalSample }}</p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>It wasn't difficult to setup your first ICO profile, was it? Perhaps it will be more difficult to create a smart-contract constructor.</p>

        <p>Congratulations you have just written your first smart contract! <b>$70,000</b> they say — and you just did it for free! Download the resulting code and follow the deployment instructions, our product is fully capable of deploying smart contracts to the local, test and main Ethereum networks! For free and without hassle! The worst offenders amongst ICO's copy\paste generic code with the names of their tokens, their owner ETH addresses and with the supply amount changed. Real ICO visionaries are getting robbed in broad daylight and we want to help stop it.</p>
        <p>So far, you have learned about our mission and our project: The Simple ICO Constructor, the ICO Presenter and the Investor Personal Profile. With these services, launching an ICO will not take more than 15 minutes of configuration process. Obviously, in order to achieve such an ambitious goal we need an experienced team of developers and contributors. So who is behind the Fondu team?</p>

        <h2>ICO</h2>
        <p>Even though we wish that a project of such scale could be fuelled by the enthusiasm of the contributors alone, there is a strong necessity for Fondu to attract investors. We have to act quickly, otherwise the community risks losing millions of dollars to scammers who continue to simply reuse stolen smart-contract code again and again, while charging enormously large fees.</p>

        <p>In order to release Fondu to market as quickly as possible, we need to hire developers, designers, and managers full-time. Our best estimate for our first year of operations is around $250,000. However, the estimated amount of money saved within the first should exceed the estimate expenses. If every 10th ICO pledges $1,000 (1/70 of the average smart contract and website budget) to Fondu, this ICO will succeed.</p>
        
        <p>The terms of the ICO are simple, all one needs to do is to transfer ETH to the ETH address below to receive FDU tokens in return. For every 1 ETH sent you will receive 250 FDU tokens until July 1st, 2019. Then the crowd funding ICO campaign will be over.</p>
        
        <p>The Fondu ICO token sale will end on July 1st, 2019. All the proceeds will be converted to USD and will be used to pay developers and contributors to the Fondu repositories. The use and purpose of FDU tokens is yet to be wholly defined, however we promise to present the use case for the Fondu platform in the near future. When buying FDU tokens, please execute extreme caution and make sure you understand that by purchasing FDU tokens, you are supporting our community and an asset that might hold no value at all in the future.</p>

        <h2>Note on open source</h2>
        <p>We intend to make Fondu fully available for free for everyone. Our intent is to give our excellent developers a chance to give back to the open source community. Our goal is to empower anyone to start their own ICO for any reason, just like anybody can create a GitHub repository. On the topic of GitHub, we are completely transparent and our smart-contract code and any code in general can always be found on <a href="https://github.com/backmeupplz/fondu">GitHub</a> under MIT license, meaning our code is open source to all those who wish to use it. As developers, we can only hope that our project delivers value to those in need, as we seek to empower and democratize the ICO process for all. Every single line of code we write within Fondu will always be open to public. Thanks!</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>We strongly believe that by possessing such an incredible amount of experience and knowledge between our developer and advisory teams, that we will be able to launch the first generation release version of the product within 2 months after the crowd sale reaches our initial target of $50,000 raised. Let nobody wait for the first ICO made on our open source free platform to be made available. The only operating constraint ahead is funding, beyond what has already been invested by us personally. We also hope that by acting together as a community we can change the way ICO's are perceived by the general public, to democratize the crypto climate away from the extravagant exceptions exploited by speculators and imitators in order to level the playing field and experience for non technical users everywhere. Only through this initiative can the rapid adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology be made possible.</p>
        <p>The Fondu developer team would like to thank you in advance, and please let us know if you have any questions by contacting us in our public Telegram group: <a href="https://t.me/project_f">@project_f</a>. Team members are online as much as possible to answer all inquiries. You're awesome – stay this way!</p>
